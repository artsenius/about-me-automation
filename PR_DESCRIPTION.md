# 🎭 Enhanced Test Automation with Accessibility & Mobile Safari Fixes

## 🎯 Overview

This PR significantly enhances the Playwright test automation framework with **comprehensive accessibility testing**, **improved configuration**, and **Mobile Safari fixes**. All 22 Chromium tests are passing ✅, and the framework now provides much better coverage and developer experience.

## ✨ What's New

### 🆕 Accessibility Testing Suite
- **New test file**: `tests/accessibility.spec.js` with 10 comprehensive accessibility tests
- Tests for WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and more
- Dedicated accessibility browser configuration for specialized testing
- Ready for `@axe-core/playwright` integration (dependency added to package.json)

### 🚀 Intelligent Test Runner
- **New script**: `run-tests.sh` with multiple execution options:
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh --all              # Run all stable tests
  ./run-tests.sh --chromium         # Chromium only
  ./run-tests.sh --accessibility    # Accessibility tests
  ./run-tests.sh --mobile           # Mobile Safari (with timeout handling)
  ./run-tests.sh --single FILE      # Specific test file
  ./run-tests.sh --debug --headed   # Debug mode
  ```

### 🔧 Enhanced Configuration
- **Improved timeouts**: Better handling for navigation and actions
- **Chrome stability**: Added launch options for better reliability
- **Environment support**: `SKIP_WEBKIT=true` for environments without WebKit
- **CI/CD ready**: Added retry logic and worker configuration

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Mobile Safari Timeout Resolution
- ❌ **Before**: Mobile Safari tests would timeout indefinitely (900s+)
- ✅ **After**: Conditional execution with proper environment detection
- ⚙️ **Solution**: Environment variable control and improved timeout handling

### Test Stability
- Enhanced waiting strategies with `navigationTimeout` and `actionTimeout`
- Better error handling for missing system dependencies
- Chrome launch flags for improved stability in containerized environments

## 📊 Test Results

### Current Status
- ✅ **Chromium**: 22/22 tests passing (38.1s execution time)
- ⚠️ **Mobile Safari**: Environment-dependent (now handles gracefully)
- 🆕 **Accessibility**: 10 new tests covering WCAG standards

### Coverage Areas
| Test Suite | Tests | Coverage |
|------------|--------|----------|
| About Page | 6 | Profile, resume, skills, achievements |
| About App Page | 4 | Navigation, sections, GitHub links |
| Contact Page | 4 | Contact cards, copy functionality |
| Header Navigation | 2 | Links, active states, mobile menu |
| Footer | 2 | Consistency across pages |
| Live Automation | 4 | Dashboard, expansion, API integration |
| **🆕 Accessibility** | **10** | **WCAG, keyboard nav, ARIA, focus** |

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### Configuration Enhancements
```javascript
// playwright.config.js improvements
- Better timeout handling (30s navigation, 45s mobile)
- Chrome launch options for stability
- Accessibility-focused browser configuration
- Environment-based test skipping
- CI/CD optimized settings
```

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive test runner** with intuitive options
- **Detailed error reporting** with HTML artifacts
- **Environment detection** prevents hanging tests
- **Test analysis report** with actionable recommendations

## 📋 Testing Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run all stable tests
./run-tests.sh --all

# Run specific test types
./run-tests.sh --accessibility

```

### For Reviewers
```bash
# Test the new accessibility suite
./run-tests.sh --accessibility

# Verify Mobile Safari handling
./run-tests.sh --mobile  # Should handle gracefully

# Test specific functionality
./run-tests.sh --single tests/about-page.spec.js
```
