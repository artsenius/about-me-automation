# GitHub Actions Failure Analysis and Fixes

## Summary
I investigated the GitHub Actions failures in the `artsenius/about-me-automation` repository and identified several critical issues that were causing test failures. I've implemented fixes that resolve the main problems.

## Primary Issues Found

### 1. ‚ùå **CRITICAL: Wrong Target URL (404 Error)**
**Problem**: The GitHub Actions workflow was testing a non-existent URL
- **Workflow URL**: `https://artsenius.github.io/about-me` ‚Üí **404 Not Found**
- **Correct URL**: `https://artsenius.github.io/about/` ‚Üí **200 OK**

**Root Cause**: URL mismatch between workflow configuration and actual website location

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `.github/workflows/nightly-tests.yml` line 29: 
  ```yaml
  # Before
  BASE_URL: 'https://artsenius.github.io/about-me'
  # After  
  BASE_URL: 'https://artsenius.github.io/about/'
  ```

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Playwright config had URL without trailing slash causing redirects
- **Config URL**: `https://artsenius.github.io/about` ‚Üí **301 Redirect**
- **Direct URL**: `https://artsenius.github.io/about/` ‚Üí **200 OK**

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `playwright.config.js` line 20:
  ```javascript
  // Before
  baseURL: 'https://artsenius.github.io/about',
  // After
  baseURL: 'https://artsenius.github.io/about/',
  ```

### 3. üîß **Missing System Dependencies (GitHub Actions Environment)**
**Problem**: GitHub Actions runner missing required system libraries for Playwright
- **Issue**: `libicu74`, `libgtk-4`, etc. not available in standard Ubuntu runners
- **Status**: This is an environment issue that requires workflow updates

**Recommendation**: Add system dependency installation to workflow:
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y \
      libicu74 \
      libgtk-4-1 \
      libgstreamer-1.0-0 \
      libgstbase-1.0-0
```

### 4. üìù **Minor Test Issues**
**Problem**: One test failing due to missing UI element
- **Test**: Resume download button not found
- **Selector**: `[data-testid="resume-link"]`
- **Status**: This requires verification of the actual website elements

## Test Results After Fixes

‚úÖ **Before Fixes**: Tests couldn't run due to 404 errors
‚úÖ **After Fixes**: 5 out of 6 tests now passing successfully  
‚ùå **Remaining Issue**: 1 test failing (resume button element not found)

### Successful Test Areas:
- Profile section display ‚úÖ
- Summary and current role sections ‚úÖ  
- Company links validation ‚úÖ
- Technical skills section (24 skills) ‚úÖ
- Achievements section ‚úÖ

### Still Failing:
- Resume download functionality (element not found)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The main URL fix should resolve most GitHub Actions failures
2. **Environment**: Add system dependency installation to handle Playwright requirements  
3. **Element Investigation**: Verify the resume button selector on the live website
4. **Monitoring**: Run the workflow to confirm fixes work in GitHub Actions environment

## Impact Assessment

**Before**: ~100% test failures due to 404 errors
**After**: ~83% test success rate (5/6 tests passing)
**Improvement**: Major resolution of blocking issues

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/nightly-tests.yml` - Fixed target URL
- `playwright.config.js` - Fixed base URL configuration

These fixes address the root cause of the GitHub Actions failures and should significantly improve test reliability.
